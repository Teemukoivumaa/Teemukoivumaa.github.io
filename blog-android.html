                        <h1>Android crypto mining</h1>
                        <p class="blogText">
							With the recent "crypto boom" I started getting into it cryptocurrencies. I purchased some cryptocurrencies (Cardano & Algorand mainly)
							and I started wondering if I could mine with my Raspberry Pi. Looked it up and in ten minutes I was mining with my Raspberry Pi.
							Great! Well that was simple!
							
							<br> <br>

							The hashrate was really low, being about 100h/s. 
							<i class="smallText">(Hashrate is a simply but the speed of mining. It is measured in units of hash/second, meaning how many calculations per second can be performed.)</i>
                            And 100h/s is <i>really</i> slow compared to a quite low end modern CPU, for example the Ryzen 5 2600 CPU. That one can do about <a href="https://xmrig.com/benchmark?cpu=AMD+Ryzen+5+2600+Six-Core+Processor">4000h/s</a> and even more.
							
							<br> <br>

							But then I tought, <i>"If I can mine crypto with Raspberry Pi, surely I could with a Android device?"</i> And then I started researching how to get a terminal in Android.
							Thankfully in the Google Play Store there was already a terminal app called <a href="https://termux.com/">Termux</a>. Termux seems to be the only terminal emulator that has succesfully made a package manager within the app.
							With a package manager we can add custom packages and that is necessary for this to work.
							<br> <br>

					<h2>Why?</h2>
					<p class="blogText">
						The main reason for this is to learn. <br>
						You wont be going to make money from mining with your Android device. (Maybe in the long run but more on that later) <br>
						People have also told me that they mine with their Android devices because it supports the blockchain, not greatly but it's better than nothing.
					</p>

					<br><br>
					
					<a name="how"></a>
					<h2>How?</h2>
					<p class="blogText">
						<i>Installation, Build & Run instructions</i> <br>
						<i class="smallText">Please run the commands without the ' marks.</i>
					</p>
					<p class="instructions">
						<br>
							<b>1.</b> Download & Install Termux app from the Google Play Store for free.
						<br>
							<b>2.</b> Open Termux and update the dependencies: <i>'apt-get update && apt-get upgrade'</i>
						<br>
							<b>3.</b> Install git, build-essential & cmake: <i>'​pkg install git build-essential cmake -y'​</i>
						<br>
							<b>4.</b> Get XMRig from git: <i>'git clone https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig.git'</i>
						<br>
							<b>5.</b> Make build dir and navigate to the directory: <i>'mkdir xmrig/build && cd xmrig/build'</i>
						<br>
							<b>6.</b> Build XMRig with cmake: <i>'cmake .. -DWITH_HWLOC=OFF && make -j$(nproc)'</i>
						<br>
							<b>7.1</b> Run XMRig with a command or create a config file. You can create a config file from https://xmrig.com/wizard.
						<br>
							<b>7.2</b> Running XMRig with command: <i>'./xmrig -o {POOL_ADDRESS} -a rx -k -u {USERNAME} -p x'</i> <br>
							<i>Please note that this is just an example. Please follow the pools instructions how to point your miner to the right place.</i>
						<br><br>
					</p>
					<p class="blogText">
						And with that, you are all set up and can start mining! <br>
						<i><a href="https://pastebin.com/Dy0VsNEJ" target="_blank">Pastebin link </a>for easier copy-pasting on mobile</i> <br> <br>
						<b>RECOMMENDED:</b> <br>
						Manually set "acquire wakelock" by pulling down on Termux app notification. 
						This tells Android to not mess with the Termux app. Thermal throttling will quickly occur to protect itself, no additional action is actually needed.
						<br><br>
						<b>KNOWN ISSUES:</b> <br>
						Wakelock may not be adequate to protect against the Android OS overriding and killing the XMRig thread within Termux. <br>
						You can try to turn the battery optimization off for the app from the settings! This at least worked for me, and I have been running the phone with the screen closed for more hashes.
						But I think this option is only available for the newer devices.
					</p>

					<a name="shouldI"></a>
					<h2>Should I?</h2>
					<p class="blogText">
						<i>My toughts, Results & Conclusion</i><br>
					</p>
					<p class="blogText">
						Eh, maybe if you have a spare phone that you won't be using anymore? The device needs to be plugged in 24/7 of course, and that will degrade the battery with the combination of the heat of the CPU. 
						Also, the long time returns are very small when compared to how much the phone has cost.<br>
						<br>
						With that said, this setup uses very little power in return with a "pretty good" hashrate. I recommend people to test this for fun, at least if you have some devices just lying around and collecting dust. 
						But be aware that the hashrate will be different on older and newer devices! I tried using this with an old tablet and got an amazing 50 hashrate on that. 
						So the device should have a good amount of RAM because my old tablet only has 1GB!
						<br> <br>
						Also the CPU's cache plays an important part because with more cache XMRig can operate more threads. <br>
						More threads == bigger hashrate
						<br> <br> <br>

						<i>Results</i> <br> 
						Currently, on my Pocophone F1 that has 6GB RAM & is running on Snapdragon 845.
						I'm getting a steady 450 hashes and have been running for over two days straight. <br><br>
						The phone is drawing ~3.8W from the outlet and with some 
						<a href="https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/calculator/xmr?HashingPower=400&HashingUnit=H%2Fs&PowerConsumption=3.8&CostPerkWh=0.12&MiningPoolFee=" target="_blank">calculations</a> 
						profit per day is about <b>$0.02375</b> and yearly profit is about <b>$8.67</b>. <br><br>
						After running the phone for 24 hours the phone used about <b>0,101195kWh</b> of electricity so in total it cost <b>$0,00121434</b> to run for a day. <i class="smallText">(0,101195kWh * $0,12 = $0,0121434)</i> <br>
						So with my electricity plan it costs nearly nothing to run it all day, all night with daily profits of $0.02 .
						<br> <br> <br>

						<i>Conclusion</i> <br>
						A bit of an anticlimactic results isn't it? I didn't have my expectations very high with this project but maybe I expected a bit different results. <br><br>
						At least in my opinion it isn't worth it / wise to mine cryptocurrencies with your Android device. <br> <br>
						But as an learning experience it was really fun and worth it. 
						I learned a lot about cryptocurrencies and how to mine them when researching for this blog post, and when figuring out how to start mining on Android device.

						Thank your for reading this blog post!<br> <br>
						This was my first one that I researched & have composed. Feedback is appreciated. <br><br><br>
