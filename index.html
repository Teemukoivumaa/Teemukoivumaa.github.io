						<span class="jobType">1.9.2021 – 31.12.2021</span>
						<h3>Trainee, DevOps engineer at <i>OP Financial Group</i> </h3>
						<span class="jobType">Back-end</span> <br />
						<p class="jobDesc">
							After the summer job period, I got the change to continue working in the same project and doing my apprenticeship at the same time. <br><br>
							
							The work that I did daily was the same as in the summer period, but I was more familiar by this time and didn't need as much help when working on a task. <br><br>
							
							We had an multinational team and I became better at speaking English, because we had daily standups and other meetings, where I presented what I was currently
							working on and what is done. Also in the last two months I took a bit bigger role to lead the daily standups, backlog grooming-sessions and general meetings
							that we had in smaller group. <br><br>

							In general, I learned even more about making good maintainable code, working as a team and more about CI/CD.
						</p>

						<h3>Summer Trainee, DevOps engineer at <i>OP Financial Group</i> </h3>
						<span class="jobType">Back-end</span> <br />
						<p class="jobDesc">
							At OP I developed and maintained their CI/CD Jenkins pipelines. <br><br>
							
							Before starting at OP I had minimal experience in CI/CD and I learned a lot in the few months working. <br>
							While working I learned why CI/CD is useful and why you should always unit test your code. <br>
							But maybe the biggest things that I learned is, how to work in a team, how to make good code and how to proberly use Git. <br><br>
							The work consisted of maintaining the pipelines, working on new improvements and supporting the users that use the pipelines. <br>

						<h3>Summer Trainee, RF BB test automation at <i>Nokia</i> </h3>
						<span class="jobType">Full stack</span> <br />
						<p class="jobDesc">
							My biggest accomplishment when I worked at Nokia was that I
							learned a lot in a quick span. I worked very closely with a seven person team. <br /><br />

							When I worked at Nokia, I chose to work fully on the website that they were starting. I learned a lot about JavaScript and especially React when working on the website.
							I also worked with Flask as we used that as the API for the website. <br /><br />

							I worked on many tasks, but the most important ones were that I made file uploading from user’s computer to the website.
							Also, I worked with chart library that made interactive charts that changed based on the information on the website.

							an API and a small artificial intelligence project that I was responsible for.
